# killer-sudoku-calculator

This program is a tool for generating and selecting solutions for cage totals in Killer Sudoku puzzles or similar games. 
Enter the cage sum and number of cells in that cage then all possible combinations will be displayed.

I wrote this for myself because I wasn't happy with most of the options online, but if it's of any use to you I'm glad.

# TODO
